			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Player Tracking Data & Potential Uses</h2>
			<p>Every day analytics in sports is making progress and advances in technology have changed what aspects of the are observable.
				The NFL's official analytics service <a href="https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/">Next Gen Stats</a> now offers player tracking data,
				opening up a brand new area of research.</p>
				
			<p></p>
			
			<p>There's a great python package called <a href="https://github.com/sarahmallepalle/next-gen-scrapy">next-gen-scrapy</a> which scrapes 
				the raw pass locations from each of the pass charts on nextgenstats. Now players can be evaluted at a deeper level. For instance, imagine a 
				quarterback is shown to have a higher passing completion percentage passing to the left side of the field compared to the right. This could create a
				very impactful advantage for opposing defenses, who now can gameplan for a previously unkown weakness.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Playcalling Tendencies Can Vary Drastically Among Coaches</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center;">When observing the difference in Run/Pass splits across the previous two years, we can learn a few things 
									about this Seattle team. In 2017 (under coach Darrell Bevell) the Seahawks ran the ball less than 40% of the time, compared
									to a league high 52.2% in 2018. This difference can be attributed to the arrival of new Offensive Coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer. 
									Schottenheimer is a large proponent of the importance of running the football, but is this run heavy approach hurting the production of 
									their premium player, Russell Wilson?</p>
	<div class="row">

		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>One of the most striking takeaways from comparing the play distributions is that despite passing at a much lower rate in 2018, the Seahawks gave
		up sacks 1.1% more often than the league average. This offers another potential explanation for the Run first philosophy; Perhaps the frequency
		of which the Seahawks run the ball is less due to confidence in the value of Rushing, but more of a statement of how little they trust their ability
		to protect their franchise player in passing situations.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align: center;">How Can a Coaching Change Influence a Player's Performance?</h2>
	
				<p>With access to pass charts from the two previous years, I wanted to investigate how a player's 
								production might change when paired with different coaches. To test this hypothesis I chose two years 
								of Seattle quaterback Russell Wilson, who in 2018 played under a new Offensive Coordinator for the first
								time in his seven year career. </p>
				<p></p>
				
				<p>To evalute the impact of a the new Run first scheme on the production of QB Russell Wilson, I used next-gen-scrapy to isolate each one of
					Wilson's passing attempts from the previous two years. </p>
					
	<div class="row">
		<div class="column">
			<img src="IMG/Individual Analysis/Russ17.png" style="width: 100%">
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<img src="IMG/Individual Analysis/Russ18.png" style="width: 100%">
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p>Its hard to make any reliable inferences from these two charts, so I decided to isolate the y-coordinate for each pass to find Wilson's	
		average depth of target over each of the two years. Average Depth of Target is a good way to evaluate how free a Quaterback is to make deep
		passes downfield. In 2017, Wilson had a mean depth of target of 9.7, compared to 8.9 in 2018.</p>
		
	<p></p>
	
	<p>The difference of -0.739 average yards per depth of target suggests that Russell Wilson's passing statistics 
		have suffered since the beginning of the 2018 season and the appointment of new offensive coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer. 
		Schottenheimer's football philosophy prioritises the run game resulting in the Seahawks offense was being ranked 2nd in the league in 
		attempts (534) in 2018, compared to 23rd (409 attempts) the year prior. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WilsRu00.htm">Russell Wilson </a>
		also recorded his lowest number of pass attempts in a season since 2013 despite a TD% of 8.2 (career high),
		and a rating of 110.9 (also a career high).

			<p><small>Using R summary function to compare Wilson's Average depth of target</small></p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<p>It seems as if a talent like Russell Wilson is being somewhat wasted in a Run first offense like the Seahawks. Despite the poor pass protection
				and a scheme that minimizes his potential impact on the game, he is still a top quaterback in all major categories.</p>
