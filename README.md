Liam Cullen - Q5063319 - Final Year Project Artefact

My submission includes the site files for my artefact which is accessible at the gitpages site: liamcullencs.github.io/BoxCount

I have also included all of the R scripts used during this project to produce all the data visualisations, as well as four CSV datasets.
These scripts are also accessible via my github - github.com/LiamCullenCS/ELO-Ratings or github.com/LiamCullenCS/BoxCount
